    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow accessible to undergraduate physical chemistry students to support the use of research software to facilitate quantum mechanical modeling. Each small molecule radical investigated in this experiment consists of a central carbon atom and 3 different heteroatoms (H, F, Cl, Br, or I). To compute meaningful data using a separate quantum mechanics modeling software (ORCA), students need to generate input guess geometries and write the input files for the program. When the quantum mechanics modeling is complete, students need to parse through long log files detailing the results of the computations and present the data in a manner that enables further analysis.  \n",

Students can use this single input file to generate starting 3D molecular structures for their quantum mechanical simulations in a reproducible fashion. Because this step is automated, students can examine many more structures that would normally be possible in a 3 hour lab period.  \n",

One complexity students may encounter that is handled by the code below is that SMILES strings utilize implicit hydrogen atoms. This means that the hydrogen atoms in the molecular structures are not expressed in the strings themselves, rather they are inferred by the operating package rdkit. This can lead to challenges writing the geometries."
